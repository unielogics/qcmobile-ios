// `src/lib/legal.ts` and QCWeb's `src/lib/legal-content.ts` exactly —
// by design — so users see the same prose across web, dashboard, and
// mobile.
//
// When the documents are revised:
//   1. Bump TERMS_VERSION / PRIVACY_VERSION / DISCLOSURE_VERSION to the
//      new effective date.
//   2. Replace the body copy below.
//   3. Update QCDashboard's `src/lib/legal.ts` AND QCWeb's
//      `src/lib/legal-content.ts` in lockstep — all three files must
//      stay byte-equivalent in their `*_VERSION` constants and section
//      prose.
//   4. Existing user acceptances stay attached to the version they
//      accepted — the AppShell will re-prompt them (future work) when
//      version > their latest accepted row from /legal/acceptance.
//
// v1.0 (Effective 2026-05-19) is the first deploy of the finalized
// post-counsel prose. Approved by Jonathan Franco, Executive Partner.

    "Qualified Commercial LLC — formed in New Jersey. Mailing address: 14 53rd St #408N, Brooklyn, NY 11232. Contact: support@qualifiedcommercial.com. Version 1.0, approved by Jonathan Franco, Executive Partner. This disclosure explains important limitations and consents related to funding projections, AI underwriting support, internal file audits, lender package submission, communications, e-signatures, payment authorization, advertising, data security, downtime, and post-closing servicing.",
  sections: [
    {
      heading: "1. QualifiedCommercial Is a Technology and Funding Workflow Platform",
      paragraphs: [
        "QualifiedCommercial helps users collect information, organize documents, prepare funding files, obtain authorizations, manage communications, and submit validated packages to selected third-party lending companies or funding partners. Unless a separate written agreement says otherwise, Qualified Commercial LLC does not itself provide the final loan, service the loan after closing, guarantee approval, guarantee closing, guarantee rate locks, or act as post-closing customer support for the lender or servicer.",

      heading: "2. AI Underwriter and AI Pipeline Disclosure",
      paragraphs: [
        "QualifiedCommercial uses AI-assisted underwriting and workflow tools. The AI may review uploaded documents, identify missing items, summarize files, generate internal observations, estimate scenarios, assist with communications, and help realtors/brokers/agents manage delegated pipeline tasks. AI can make mistakes. AI may produce inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, inconsistent, outdated, or unsupported results.",
        "AI-generated outputs are not final underwriting decisions, final lender decisions, legal advice, tax advice, appraisals, valuations, credit approvals, commitments to lend, rate locks, or guarantees. Human users, professional users, and lenders must review and validate information before using it for real underwriting, communications, payment authorization, signature requests, lender submission, or business decisions.",

      heading: "3. Internal File Audit and Hard Credit Pull Distinction",
      paragraphs: [
        "QualifiedCommercial may conduct an internal file audit using information supplied by the user, realtor, broker, agent, borrower, guarantor, or authorized representative. This internal audit may evaluate document completeness, funding fit, property information, financial information, user-supplied credit-related information, and potential lender-package readiness. An internal audit alone does not necessarily create a hard credit inquiry.",
        "A hard credit pull requires a separate authorization. If a user authorizes a hard pull, the user authorizes QualifiedCommercial, its credit/reporting provider, selected lending partners, funding partners, processors, underwriters, and related service providers to obtain consumer reports, credit reports, and related credit information for a permissible funding, underwriting, processing, placement, servicing, or related purpose. A hard credit inquiry may appear on the user's credit report and may affect the user's credit score.",

      heading: "4. Lender Package Submission and Third-Party Underwriting",
      paragraphs: [
        "When a file is validated and ready for real underwriting, QualifiedCommercial may push or transmit the lending package, documents, data, and related information to selected third-party lending companies, funding partners, processors, underwriters, credit/reporting vendors, and service providers. No unrelated party receives the information for independent marketing or lead sale purposes. Information is shared for the funding workflow, underwriting, processing, servicing, compliance, security, or legally required purposes described in the Privacy Policy.",
        "The lending company, funding partner, investor, underwriter, or servicer may impose additional requirements, request additional documents, adjust terms, decline the file, modify conditions, or make final decisions independently. QualifiedCommercial does not control every lender requirement or post-submission result.",

      paragraphs: [
        "Not all loan projections, scenarios, estimated HUDs, payment amounts, internal underwriting terms, AI findings, prequalification indicators, or expected lender terms close as projected. Results may change because of market changes, rate changes, lender overlays, credit information, property valuation, appraisal results, title issues, insurance issues, borrower delay, document delay, human delay to lock rates, third-party processing time, lender conditions, servicing requirements, or other factors.",
        "Users should not rely on preliminary projections as a guarantee of profitability, affordability, approval, rate, funding amount, closing date, or final lender acceptance.",

      paragraphs: [
        "Realtors, brokers, agents, and professional users are responsible for supervising the AI pipeline, reviewing delegated tasks, maintaining proper authority from their clients, obtaining client consents, verifying documents, checking communications before sending, and ensuring that their use of QualifiedCommercial complies with professional, advertising, real estate, lending, privacy, and consumer protection obligations.",
        "QualifiedCommercial will not sell realtor-uploaded leads or client contacts and will not attempt to make business with those clients outside the relationship provided by the realtor, broker, or agent, except where the client independently contacts QualifiedCommercial, a separate authorization is provided, the relationship is no longer applicable, or law requires action. QualifiedCommercial may communicate with those clients as needed to complete authorized file tasks, signatures, document requests, AI workflow messages, and lender package processing.",

        "Messages may relate to account access, identity verification, file updates, document requests, signature requests, missing items, payment authorization, AI workflow tasks, lender package status, reminders, security, service announcements, and support. SMS/text messages may be sent through Twilio or another provider. Message frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. Reply STOP to opt out where supported and HELP for help where supported. Opting out may prevent timely file processing or reduce platform functionality.",

By signing electronically or clicking to accept, the user agrees that electronic signatures, checkboxes, typed names, drawn signatures, click-to-sign actions, OTP confirmations, and similar actions may be legally binding and may be used to document consent.",
        "The platform may capture signer identity, email, phone, IP address, device/browser, timestamp, document version, consent text, audit trail, and final PDF or certificate. Users can request a paper copy or withdraw electronic consent by contacting QualifiedCommercial, but withdrawal may delay or prevent the completion of the file.",

      paragraphs: [
        "If a user authorizes a credit card or payment method, the user authorizes the charge or payment according to the amount, purpose, timing, and terms shown in the authorization screen or signed authorization. QualifiedCommercial should use tokenized or hosted payment processing where possible. QualifiedCommercial does not intentionally store CVV/CVC codes and should not store full raw card numbers in its database or signed PDFs. Payment records may show card brand, last four digits, expiration month/year, token/reference ID, authorized amount, purpose, timestamp, and audit record.",

QualifiedCommercial may use Meta/Facebook, Google Ads, cookies, pixels, SDKs, and similar tools for analytics, retargeting, conversion measurement, and advertising. Retargeting ads may appear in the user's feed or other digital placements. Some laws may classify certain retargeting or analytics activity as targeted advertising or sharing, even when information is not sold for money. Users can review choices in the Privacy Policy.",

The platform may be unavailable, delayed, degraded, or interrupted due to AWS outages, third-party vendor outages, mobile carrier issues, internet failures, maintenance, security events, software defects, or other causes. QualifiedCommercial is not responsible for lender decisions, post-closing servicing support, or third-party outages outside its control.",

QualifiedCommercial does not represent that it is the lender's customer support or servicing department unless a separate written servicing agreement expressly says so.",
